## This site
Welcome to my personal research site. I'll be using this site for news, updates on research articles, and blog posts. The layout and design are work in progress, as I slowly learn more about Git, Markdown and Jekyll. 

## Research

I'm interested in mammal diversity - past, and present. Through my research I aim to identify the mechanisms that generate spatial and taxonomic patterns of diversity, and the processes that threaten it. My broader interests include ecomorphology and phylogenetic comparative methods; one of my ongoing projects involves relating ecology to morphology to phylogeny in rodents using museum collections and phylogenies.  

## Background

For my PhD (University of Queensland: 2010-2014), I investigated the relationship beween phylogeny and extinction risk in mammals. This research explored how the evolutionary age of a lineage relates to its current extinction risk (it doesn't) and the effects of extinctions on phylogenetic diversity and tree topologies.  

Before that, I studied the ecology of bat migration for my BSc research thesis while studying biology at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (2004-2009) and worked at the Mammalogy Department at the Museum of Zoology, Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM.
