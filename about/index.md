## Research

I'm interested in mammal diversity - past, and present. Through my research I aim to identify the mechanisms that generate spatial and taxonomic patterns of diversity, and the processes that threaten it. My broader interests include ecomorphology and phylogenetic comparative methods; one of my ongoing projects involves relating ecology to morphology to phylogeny in rodents using museum collections and phylogenies.  

## Background

For my PhD (University of Queensland: 2010-2014), I investigated the relationship beween phylogeny and extinction risk in mammals. This research explored how the evolutionary age of a lineage relates to its current extinction risk (it doesn't) and the effects of extinctions on phylogenetic diversity and tree topologies.  

Before that, I studied the ecology of bat migration for my BSc research thesis while studying biology at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (2004-2009) and worked at the Mammalogy Department at the Museum of Zoology, Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM.
