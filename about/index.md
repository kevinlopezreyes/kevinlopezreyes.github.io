## This site
Welcome to my personal research page. I'll be using this site for news, updates on research articles, R code, and blog posts. The layout and design are work in progress, as I slowly learn more about Git, Markdown and Jekyll. 

## Research

I'm interested in mammal diversity - past, and present. Through my research I aim to identify the mechanisms that generate spatial and taxonomic patterns of diversity, and the processes that threaten it. My broader interests include ecomorphology, mammalian evolution, biogeography, and phylogenetic comparative methods. My ongoing project involves relating ecology to morphology to phylogeny in rodents using museum collections and phylogenies.

## Background

I am a mammalogist by training. For my PhD (University of Queensland: 2010-2014), I investigated the relationship beween phylogeny and extinction risk in mammals. This research explored how the evolutionary age of a lineage relates to its current extinction risk (it doesn't) and the effects of extinctions on phylogenetic diversity and tree topologies. Before that, I studied the ecology of bat migration for my BSc research thesis as part of a biology degree at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM; 2004-2009). I also like avian macroevolution and birding.
