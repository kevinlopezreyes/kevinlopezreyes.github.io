New presentations section and Biotweeps

I've added a presentations section to the site, and I just wanted to mention that next week I will be taking over the [Biotweeps](https://biotweep.wordpress.com/) Twitter account. I'll discuss mammals, research, early career science, and other exciting topics.

I had also prepared a really cool FlexSlider photo carousel for this site, but I failed to add it because plugins are disabled in GitHub pages and I couldn't deploy the site manually after getting the code ready. If anyone knows how to this please let me know.
