When I first wrote about tidy evaluation and the untangle2 function, I used restaurant menus as an example of how embedded subheaders are used to create small multiples of data (by type of menu item). 

After a recent update to the tesseract optical character recognition (ocr) engine, I decided to try and digitize and parse a restaruant menu from a photo. I found  this photo in my camera roll, from a nice taco place in Puerto Vallarta that we went to during the NASBR2018 bat meeting.
