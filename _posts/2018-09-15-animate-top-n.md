Thanks to the 'gganimate' package, expository demos are in season:

For previous posts, I've made graphical summaries of R functions such as this one below.

Now that I know how to make crude animations of the data-wrangling process, I made this animation of various tidyerse functions piped together. I focused on the _top\_n()_ function in 'dplyr' because I've written about it in the past and the posts still seem to get pretty regular traffic (links below).


 
[English version](https://luisdva.github.io/rstats/Top-and-bottom-values-for-groups/)  
[Spanish version](https://luisdva.github.io/Valores-m%C3%A1ximos-y-m%C3%ADnimos-para-datos-agrupados/) 


Say we have a dataset with three dogs, three cats, and three birds. We have names for each one, plus their 'cuteness' rating as a continuous value. The code to create the animation is in the gist at the end of this post (full of hacks but reproducible).

- Mutate to modify character strings, using multiple conditional statements.
- Filter to discard birds.
- Group by the type of animal.
- Get the top value for each group.

These are Luna and Lili, respectively.
