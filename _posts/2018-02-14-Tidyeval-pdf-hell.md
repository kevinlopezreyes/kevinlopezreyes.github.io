Tidyeval meets pdf table hell

Although it first became a feature of _dplyr_ in [June of 2017](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/06/13/dplyr-0-7-0/){:target="_blank"}, tidy evaluation is once again in the spotlight after the 2018 RStudio conference.  This is a good [compilation](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/08/tidyeval-resource-roundup/){:target="_blank"} of _tidyeval_ resources, and I suggest watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nERXS3ssntw){:target="_blank"} five-minute video of Hadley Wickham explaining the big ideas behind tidy evaluation while wearing a stylish sweater. 

 
When _tidyeval_ originally came out, I jumped at the chance to program with _dplyr_.  I blogged about writing a function to deal with non-data rows embedded as hierarchical headers in the data rectangle. Unsurprisingly, I butchered the use of tidyeval and function writing in general, but I was rescued by Jenny Bryan in this post.

As a biologist, the ‘untangle’ function has saved me hours upon hours of work, because comparative data always has taxonomic header rows that I usually had to tidy up by hand in a spreadsheet program. 

## PDF table hell

In my ongoing work with other people’s data, I came across values that are broken up into two lines for whatever reason (often to optimize space on a page in a table in a typeset pdf).

I encounter broken-up values frequently in my biology research, here’s an example that isn’t made up.

<figure>
    <a href="/images/becerra12.png"><img src="/images/becerra12.png"></a>
        <figcaption>Thrichomys cunicularius is broken up into two lines</figcaption>
</figure>

This is a very common practice, a lot of the pdf tables that I work with (using the awesome _tabulizer_ package) have ‘merged’ cells that end up as broken values.

Here’s a toy example with some data from the summer Olympics.

|Games            |Country   |Soccer_gold_medal |
|:----------------|:---------|:-----------------|
|Los Angeles 1984 |USA       |France            |
|Barcelona        |Spain     |Spain             |
|1992             |NA        |NA                |
|Atlanta 1996     |USA       |Nigeria           |
|Sydney 2000      |Australia |Cameroon          |
|London           |UK        |Mexico            |
|2012             |NA        |NA                |

The values for two of the games (Barcelona 1992 & London 2012) are broken up into separate rows, adding a bunch of empty/NA values in the rows that shouldn’t really be there. 

This is what the table should look like:

|Games_unbroken   |Country   |Soccer_gold_medal |
|:----------------|:---------|:-----------------|
|Los Angeles 1984 |USA       |France            |
|Barcelona 1992   |Spain     |Spain             |
|Atlanta 1996     |USA       |Nigeria           |
|Sydney 2000      |Australia |Cameroon          |
|London 2012      |UK        |Mexico            |


Using Jenny Bryan’s version of the _untangle_ function as a template, I wrote this function to unbreak values using _tidyeval_. 

Assuming that:

> the NA values in the table only correspond to the rows with broken-up values  
> the broken-up values can be matched with regex 

this function will glue the two value fragments together and get rid of the extra row (via a hacky fill-then-slice operation). 

Let’s try it out.

After loading the _tidyverse_ set of packages and _rlang_, we’ll create the above table, define the "unbreak_vals" function, and use it – matching the rows that start out with numbers with the regex.


{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)
library(rlang)

OGames <- tibble(Games = c("Los Angeles 1984","Barcelona","1992","Atlanta 1996","Sydney 2000","London","2012"),
                Country = c("USA","Spain",NA,"USA","Australia","UK",NA),
                Soccer_gold_medal = c("France","Spain",NA,"Nigeria","Cameroon","Mexico",NA))


{% endhighlight %}

Let's check it out

{% highlight text %}
> OGames
# A tibble: 7 x 3
  Games            Country   Soccer_gold_medal
  <chr>            <chr>     <chr>            
1 Los Angeles 1984 USA       France           
2 Barcelona        Spain     Spain            
3 1992             NA        NA               
4 Atlanta 1996     USA       Nigeria          
5 Sydney 2000      Australia Cameroon         
6 London           UK        Mexico           
7 2012             NA        NA 
{% endhighlight %}

Unbreak the lines, matching strings that start with a number
{% highlight r %}
unbreak_lines <- function(df,regex,ogcol,newcol){
  ogcol <- enquo(ogcol)
  newcol <- sym(quo_name(enquo(newcol)))
  
  df %>% 
    mutate(
      !!newcol := ifelse(grepl(regex,!!ogcol),
                         yes = paste(lag(!!ogcol),!!ogcol),
                         no = !!ogcol)
    ) %>% 
    fill(everything()) %>% 
    slice(-(which(str_detect(!!ogcol,regex))-1)
    ) %>%
    select(-!!ogcol)
}

OGames %>% unbreak_lines("^[0-9]",Games,Games_unbroken) %>% 
  select(Games_unbroken,everything())
{% endhighlight %}

It worked!

{% highlight text %}
A tibble: 5 x 3
  Games_unbroken   Country   Soccer_gold_medal
  <chr>            <chr>     <chr>            
1 Los Angeles 1984 USA       France           
2 Barcelona 1992   Spain     Spain            
3 Atlanta 1996     USA       Nigeria          
4 Sydney 2000      Australia Cameroon         
5 London 2012      UK        Mexico      
{% endhighlight %}


Another case of broken values that I’ve seen is when additional descriptions are interspersed below the original values in separate rows. This is a single column-example from a spreadsheet I had lying around.  

{% highlight r %}
dogsDesc <- tibble(dogs=c("Terrier","(Lakeland)","Terrier","(Soft-coated wheaten)","Bulldog","(English)","Bulldog","(French)"))
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
> dogsDesc
# A tibble: 8 x 1
  dogs                 
  <chr>                
1 Terrier              
2 (Lakeland)           
3 Terrier              
4 (Soft-coated wheaten)
5 Bulldog              
6 (English)            
7 Bulldog              
8 (French) 
{% endhighlight %}

Matching the opening bracket with the regex:
{% highlight r %}
dogsDesc %>% unbreak_lines("^\\(",dogs,dogs_desc)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
# A tibble: 4 x 1
  dogs_desc                    
  <chr>                        
1 Terrier (Lakeland)           
2 Terrier (Soft-coated wheaten)
3 Bulldog (English)            
4 Bulldog (French)   
{% endhighlight %}


I have lots to learn about writing functions, but so far this unbreak function has already saved me lots of time and  hassle and painful spreadsheet editing.
