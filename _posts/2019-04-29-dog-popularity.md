The American Kennel Club just announced the 2018 rankings of dog breed [popularity](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/most-popular-dog-breeds-of-2018/){:target="_blank"}, collected from registration data in the USA. 

Last year, I followed this [post](https://dominikkoch.github.io/Bump-Chart/){:target="_blank"} by Dominik Koch about creating bump charts in R using _ggplot2_ to show changes in rank over time, and applied it to dog breed popularity rankings from 2013-2017. The resulting chart is below, and the code is detailed in this [entry](https://luisdva.github.io/rstats/dog-bump-chart/){:target="_blank"}.

With the new rankings out, here's a quick update to last year's post. I drew more dogs for use as custom image labels with [ggimage](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/ggimage){:target="_blank"}, and this time they are full-size pngs with transparent backgrounds, available [here](https://github.com/luisDVA/luisdva.github.io/tree/master/images/pups/){:target="_blank"}. 

The new dog drawings look like this. I assembled the little collage using MaÃ«lle Salmon's _magick_ [resources](https://masalmon.eu/tags/collage/){:target="_blank"}.

...and here's the updated plot:

The code for the updated chart is in the gist at the end of this post. The plotting code is less fiddly and I was more careful with paths when working with the images. 


Thanks for reading. Let me know if anything isn't working and feel free to reuse the dog drawings (with attribution).
