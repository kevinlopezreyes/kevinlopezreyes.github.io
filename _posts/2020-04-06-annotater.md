Last year, I was helping some labmates that were having issues with their R scripts, and I noticed that they were struggling simply because the scripts they were using had many `library()` calls for obscure remote sensing packages they didn't need, some of which had installation and dependency issues.

The screenshot below comes from a spreadsheet with data from a regional event for the American Kennel Clubâ€™s Coursing Ability Test ([CAT](https://www.akc.org/sports/coursing/coursing-ability-test/){:target="_blank"}), which consists of timed 100-yard dashes for dogs.
