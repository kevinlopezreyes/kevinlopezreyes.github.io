At some point, we all have had to deal with spreadsheets in which group membership was color coded (see the replies to this tweet):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m seeking TRUE, crazy spreadsheet stories. Happy to get the actual sheet or just a description of the crazy. Also: I can keep a secret.</p>&mdash; Jenny Bryan (@JennyBryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/722954354198597632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Here’s a quick workflow that uses a new function in [`unheadr`](https://github.com/luisDVA/unheadr) to annotate meaningful formatting (cell coloring and font formatting) used to designate group membership.

This example spreadsheet (packaged with `unheadr`) shows some tasks and behaviors that characterize a well-behaved dog, along with their respective scores. These rows belong in three different task types (shown in yellow cells and bold font), and the average score for each task type appears next to each one.

</figure>

To work with this in R, we need to translate the colors and font faces into something flatter, and then we can pull out these ‘embedded subheaders’ and put them in their own indicator column if we want a tidy data structure.

For educational purposes, this example uses the `RverbalExpressions` package by [Tyler Littlefield](https://rverbalexpressions.netlify.com/index.html) to build regular expressions, and I loaded `tidylog` by [Benjamin Elbers](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog) to print some feedback about the `dplyr` operations happening. 

Once we load (install first if necessary) the required packages, the `dog_test` spreadsheet is bundled in `unheadr` and can be loaded with `system.file()`. We then tell `annotate_mf()` which variable has the meaningful formatting we want to annotate, and the name of the new annotated variable.

{% highlight r %}
# remotes::install_github("luisDVA/unheadr")
# remotes::install_github("VerbalExpressions/RVerbalExpressions")
# install.packages("tidylog")
library(unheadr)
library(tidylog)
library(RVerbalExpressions)
library(stringr)

# prepackaged data
example_spreadsheet <- system.file("extdata/dog_test.xlsx", package = "unheadr")
# annotate the meaningful formatting
dogtest_tibble <- annotate_mf(example_spreadsheet,orig = Task, new=Task_annotated)
{% endhighlight %}

This is the resulting tibble:

{% highlight text %}
> dogtest_tibble
# A tibble: 11 x 3
   Task                                       Task_annotated                                    Score
   <chr>                                      <chr>                                             <dbl>

{% endhighlight %}

To match the values that hold annotations, we use a regular expression built using `RverbalExpressions` as an argument for `untangle2()`. We also define the variable that has the subheaders and the name of the new variable that now explicitly indicates group membership.

{% highlight r %}
# untangling annotated rows
# build regular expression
reg_expression_br <- rx_start_of_line() %>% 
  rx_find("(")
reg_expression_br
# untagle embedded subheaders
dog_test_ut <- untangle2(dogtest_tibble,reg_expression_br,Task_annotated,task_type)
{% endhighlight %}

Let’s see:

{% highlight text %}
> dog_test_ut
# A tibble: 8 x 4
  Task                        Task_annotated                   Score task_type                       
  <chr>                       <chr>                            <dbl> <chr>

{% endhighlight %}

Now let’s clean up the new variable using more regex to remove everything inside brackets (and the brackets too).

{% highlight r %}
# build regex for everything inside brackets and a trailing space
 regexp_annotation <- 
  rx_start_of_line() %>% 
    rx_find("(") %>% 
    rx_anything() %>% 
    rx_find(")") %>% 
    rx_space()
regexp_annotation  
  
# cleaning
dog_test <- dog_test_ut %>% select(-Task_annotated) %>% 
  mutate(task_type=str_remove(task_type,regexp_annotation))
{% endhighlight %}
>select: dropped one variable (Task_annotated)
mutate: changed 8 values (100%) of 'task_type' (0 new NA)

Now we can summarize the scores for each task type, and they should match the calculated value present in the first place. 
{% highlight r %}
dog_test %>% group_by(task_type) %>% summarize(mean_score=mean(Score))
{% endhighlight %}
> group_by: one grouping variable (task_type)
summarize: now 3 rows and 2 columns, ungrouped
