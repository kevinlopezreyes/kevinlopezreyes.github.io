Last week, the article "Space use by two arboreal rodent species in a Neotropical cloud forest" was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Natural History. This work is a collaboration between mammalogists at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and Ecosur, and I was invited to collaborate. This paper is a really nice integration of two B.Sc. thesis projects, describing the movement ecology and habitat features for two arboreal rodents in Central/Southern Mexico. 

[Here's](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222933.2018.1459921){:target="_blank"} the link to the full-text article, and a PDF copy is available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325137063_Space_use_by_two_arboreal_rodent_species_in_a_Neotropical_cloud_forest){:target="_blank"}. 

We studied two Neotomine-peromyscine cricetids: _Habromys schmidlyi_ and _Reithrodontomys microdon_. In general, we don't know much about the ecology of most arboreal small mammals, and there are few studies with rodents in Mesoamerica. We found vertical stratification in the rodent community in this particular study site, and provide the first published estimates of home range sizes and preferences for particular forest strata for these two species. 

Both species had home range ares of roughly 0.5 ha, but this includes going up and down the trees in the cloud forst. Harvest mice in the genus _Reithrodontomys_ are known to be good climbers, but it was still surprising to see that _R. microdon_ likes to hang out high up in the forest canopy, while _H. schmidlyi_ were more abundant in the understory (up to 10 meters high).

# Why is this a big deal

There are seven species of arboreal deer mice in the genus _Habromys_. Six of these are endemic to Mexico, and all six are highly threatened with extinction (either Endangered or Critically Endangered in the IUCN Red List). In fact, these species were identified among the top ten priority species of threatened small mammals in Mexico during a workshop organized last month by the IUCN Small Mammal Specialist Group. During the workshop, the main course of action for these species was to learn more about them, because not much is known about the genus in general. This is mostly because of their restricted distributions and secretive arboreal habits. However, we showed in the paper that with adecuate trapping in the forest canopy and some basic telemetry, we can find out important life history and population parameters that can inform conservation actions. 

This is also a big deal for me because it is the first paper (of many) in which I worked with the mammalogy department where I started my scientific training and research career. I'm happy to finally have a publication on the record with my BSc thesis supervisor and long-time mentor Dr. Livia León Paniagua, who is coincidentally _the_ specialist in all things _Habromys_.
