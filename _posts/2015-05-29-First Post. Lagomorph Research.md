## Lagomorphs!

The spring of 2015 saw a flurry of publications relevant to lagomorph biology and conservation. I've compiled some relevant links summarizing these recent papers,  research on this unique group of mammals. My latest PhD thesis paper on this topic was published in March [(link here),](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.01063/full) and 

In anticipation to the publication of this paper and her own [awesome work](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122267) which got lots of media attention, co-author and QUB lagomorph researcher [Katie Leach (@Lagomorpha_)](https://twitter.com/lagomorpha_) wrote a lovely blog post introducing the study group: 
[The Wonderful World of Lagomorphs](http://blogs.qub.ac.uk/qubio/2015/02/18/the-wonderful-world-of-lagomorphs/), and a piece on collaboration and how our paper came about: [Collaborative Research](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/qubio/2015/03/20/collaborative-research/). I then summarized the results in  [this](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/edgeblog/?p=8267) piece for the Zoological Society of London EDGE website.
