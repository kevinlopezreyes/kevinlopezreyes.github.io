ðŸ“¦ðŸ“¦ I recently released two R packages on GitHub (for now) but never wrote about them here.

## [hexsession](https://luisdva.github.io/hexsession/){:target="_blank"}

This package creates a nice interactive tile of hex logos for either:
- the libraries attached to the search path in a session (loaded packages) or,
- an arbitrary set of packages as long as they're installed

The idea came about after witnessing more sticker madness at positconf 2024 and seeing people arrange their hexagonal stickers in nice tiles.

MaÃ«lle Salmon had already written about [arranging images of hex logos using magick](https://masalmon.eu/2018/02/22/hexcombine/){:target="_blank"}, and I liked the way hexagonal logos are arranged in html format on the [hexbin](http://hexb.in/){:target="_blank"} website with a subtle css hover effect.

After much tinkering, the hexsession package can now use the logo images that come bundled with most packages and arrange them in a responsive, self-contained html tile, which can then be saved as an image. This is done through Quarto and some ugly js code.

Possible uses for these tiles include crediting packages by adding their logos in a tile to presentations/reports/websites, or displaying the logos por the components of a metapackage or package collection. 


Note that not all packages bundle their logos in `man/figures` and the functions are still work in progress. There has been some feedback in the GiHub issues, but I've yet to see people making nice logo tiles. Please make some and tag me!

## [forgts](https://luisdva.github.io/forgts/){:target="_blank"}

Spreadsheets will always be around they will usually have cell or text formatting. The forgts package reads the data in a spreadsheet, imports the text and cell formatting (e.g. font face and color, cell borders, cell fills, etc.), and applies it to a gt version of the data.

</p>


This idea came from me having to take screenshots of formatted spreadsheets so that I could show things in presentations for teaching. I'm not sure how the functions will behave with large workbooks or really crazy formatting. The package is quite new but please try it out!

Thanks for reading.
