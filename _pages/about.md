## Personal Profile
Hi everyone, Kevin here. I am a Mexican PhD student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I enjoy watching horror movies and anime, hiking, and I am a huge Coldplay fan. I am also studying Japanese. おつかれさまです！

## Research
My research aims to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that determine why species occur where they do, and why some regions harbor more species than others. I integrate species occurrence data, phylogenetic information, and environmental variables to build predictive models that reveal how ecological factors and evolutionary history shape global patterns of biodiversity. I am especially drawn to reptiles due to their remarkable diversity in morphology and life histories. Their evolutionary history includes striking examples of adaptive radiations and the ability to colonize a variety of habitats. These features make reptiles an exceptional model system for addressing fundamental questions in ecology and evolutionary biology.
