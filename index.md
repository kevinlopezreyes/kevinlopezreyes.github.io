Hi everyone, and thank you for visiting my webpage!

# About this page
This is my personal academic site where I share information about my research, interests, and projects.  
Here you will find updates about my scientific work, photos from fieldwork and academic events, as well as other topics I enjoy.

The website is still under construction, so some sections might change soon â€” but feel free to look around!
