Hi everyone, and thank you for visiting my site!

# About this site
This is my personal academic site where I share information about my research, interests, and projects.  
Here you will find updates about my scientific work, wildlife and other photos, as well as other topics I enjoy.

The website is still under construction, so some sections might change soon, but feel free to look around!
